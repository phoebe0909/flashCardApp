# Welcome to my flashcard generator! 
The purpose of the app is to help students create flashcards and use them as study tools. There is currently one quiz
option available. More are on the way.

The app is still very much under construction. As a self-taught Kotlin and Android developer, I've used this app as 
an opportunity to dig into the Android documentation and learn new skills. As I add to my skillset as a developer, I 
continue to return to this app and improve it.

## Some of the new techniques that I learned from this project: 
Creating animations, toolbars and menu items. 

Finding Context in any context. 

Building with recyclerView and other layout options.


## Upcoming goals for the project:   
Data is currently stored in system preferences, but as I continue to learn more about Android, I'll re-examine the data storage options. 

Users will be able to upload spreadsheets or export their flashcards as spreadsheets.



## Skip ahead to the good stuff:   
If you'd like to take a look at my code without having to dig through a lot of folders, Main Activity is the best place to start:
